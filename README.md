# Escort Service Rules v1.0.0

Escort Service is a co-op deck-building rogue-like game. You play as a group of mech pilots escorting a shuttle of civilians to safety. You must fight off waves of enemies and escort the shuttle to their home planet. If the shuttle is destroyed, you lose.

The actions you take to defend the shuttle will often generate heat that must be vented, pushing you farther away from the shuttle. Big actions generate more heat, so you must balance your actions to stay close to the shuttle.

## Game Setup

-   Lay out the shuttle and 4 column cards in the center of the table
-   Place damage counters in a pile that is easily accessible
-   Each player should choose a mech
    -   Grab the character cards, starting deck, and advanced action deck for your character
    -   Shuffle your starting deck and place it in front of you along with one of your character cards.
    -   Shuffle your advanced action deck and place it nearby
    -   Draw 4 cards from your starting deck
-   Proceed to scenario setup when everyone is ready

## Scenario Setup

-   Place enemies on the board according to the scenario
-   Place player character cards in a column above the shuttle in any order the team chooses

## Game Play

Game play will proceed with 1 unit acting at a time. The unit immediately above the shuttle is the active unit. The unit will perform actions until they are done. After the active unit has completed their turn, the unit that is now in the position immediately above the shuttle will become the active unit. This process will continue until the scenario resolves or the shuttle is destroyed.

## On Your Turn

-   Play as many cards as you like from your hand one at a time
-   Once you are done playing cards:
    -   If you are still immediately above the shuttle, generate 1 heat
    -   Discard any cards you like that remain in your hand
    -   Draw cards from your draw pile until you have 4 cards in your hand

## Drawing Cards

Cards are drawn from your draw pile. If you need to draw a card and your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile and place it face down to create a new draw pile.

## Playing Cards

Each card will list 1 or more actions. Each action must be resolved in the order listed on the card. You must fully resolve an action before moving on to the next action on the card.

## Taking Actions

Whether playing cards or resolving actions printed on a unit card, actions resolve in the same manner. The card or unit will have a list of 1 or more actions, and each action is resolved 1 at a time.

    -   **LEFT | RIGHT | UP | DOWN**: the action can only affect targets that are in the direction specified

#### HEAT

When a unit generates heat, it must vent that heat by moving to the right a number of columns equal to the heat generated. If there aren't enough columns to the right of the unit to vent the heat, they are not prevented from taking the action.Instead, when he unit gets to the rightmost column, they will take damage equal to the amount of heat that was not vented.

#### Status Effects

Some cards will apply a status to a unit. Status effects will have the status noted at the bottom of the card surrounded by the associated icon. When you play a card that applies a status effect, place that card under the affected unit with the status effect showing. The status effect will remain until the card becomes the active unit. At that time, the card is returned to its owner's discard pile.

#### Status Types

-   **TAUNT**: when an active unit is choosing an enemy unit as the target of an attack, they must choose a unit with the Taunt status if able.
-   **SHIELD**: when a unit with the shield status takes any amount of damage, remove the shield status and prevent that instance of damage.
-   **POISON**: when a unit with the poison status takes damage, they take an additional 1 damage.
-   **HIDDEN**: a unit with the hidden status cannot be targeted by any enemy action. AOE actions can still affect the hidden unit.
