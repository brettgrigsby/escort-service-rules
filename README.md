# Escort Service

Escort Service is a co-op deck-building rogue-like game. You play as a group of mech pilots escorting a shuttle of civilians to safety. You must fight off waves of enemies and escort the shuttle to their home planet. If the shuttle is destroyed, you lose.

The actions you take to defend the shuttle will ofter generate heat that must be vented, pushing you farther away from the shuttle. Big actions generate more heat, so you must balance your actions to stay close to the shuttle.

## Game Setup

-   Lay out the shuttle and 4 column cards in the center of the table
-   Place damage counters in a pile that is easily accessible
-   Each player should choose a mech
    -   Grab the 2 character cards, starting deck, and advanced action deck for your character
    -   Shuffle your starting deck and draw 4 cards
-   Proceed to scenario setup when everyone is ready

## Scenario Setup

-   Place enemies on the board according to the scenario
-   Place player character cards in a column above the shuttle in any order the team chooses

## Game Play

Game play will proceed with 1 unit acting at a time. The unit immediately above the shuttle is the active unit. The unit will perform actions until they are done. After the active unit has completed their turn, the unit that is now in the position immediately above the shuttle will become the active unit. This process will continue until the scenario resolves or the shuttle is destroyed.

## Taking Actions

Whether playing cards or resolving actions printed on a unit card, actions resolve in the same manner. The card or unit will have a list of 1 or more actions, and each action is resolved 1 at a time.

### Action types

-   Heat: the amount of heat generated by the action that must be vented
-   Melee Attack: deal damage to a target equal to the number to the right of the melee icon
-   Ranged Attack: deal damage to a target equal to the number to the right of the ranged icon
-   Heal: remove damage from a target equal to the number to the right of the heal icon
-   Delay: move the target to the right a number of columns equal to the number to the right of the delay icon
-   Advance: move the target to the left a number of columns equal to the number to the right of the advance icon
-   Discard: choose a number of cards from your hand to discard equal to the number to the right of the discard icon and put them in your discard pile

#### Action Modifiers

-   AoE: the action affects all units within range of the action
-   IN: the action can only affect target that fall within the range of the action
    -   IN <Number>: the action can only affect targets that are within <Number> spaces of the unit
    -   LEFT | RIGHT | UP | DOWN: the action can only affect targets that are in the direction specified

#### Status Effects

Some cards will apply a status to a unit. Status effects will have the status noted at the bottom of the card surrounded by the associated icon. When you play a card that applies a status effect, place that card under the affected unit with the status effect showing. The status effect will remain until the card becomes the active unit. At that time, the card is returned to its owner's discard pile.

#### Heat

When a unit generates heat, it must vent that heat by moving to the right a number of columns equal to the heat generated. If there aren't enough columns to the right of the unit to vent the heat, they are not prevented from taking the action.Instead, when he unit gets to the rightmost column, they will take damage equal to the amount of heat that was not vented.
